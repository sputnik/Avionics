1. X = Ax(k-1) + Bu + w(k-1)
	where X is the signal value, 
	Ax is the linear combination of its prev. value + control signal,
	u is process noise (most likey we dont have to worry about it_,
	
2. Z(k) = Hx(k) + v(k)
	where Z is measurement value (one of the kalman input)
	H is signal value 
	v is measurement noise 

	Both A, B, H are matrices, but in this case it should be a constant value

3. Kalman Gain = K(k) = P`(k)H^T (HP`(k)H`T + R) ^ -1

4. Estimate X(k) = K(k) * Z(k) + (1-K(k)) * X(k-1)
	where K is measurement, K is kalman gain
	
The votage example, where a constant votage of a is measired:
	
	X = x(k-1) + w(k) (kalman gain) 
	
	z = xk + vk 
	
	K(k) = (P`(k) / (P`(k) + R) (intemediate step)
