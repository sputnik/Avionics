File describing how to set up sockets and actually run them.

Needed for python files: I've been using the latest version of python, python37.
I've tried using it with python 27 but it doesn't work, so changes would need to be made.

Make sure to install python 37 for all users in the C:/Python37 location so the start.bat files know where to look for python files.

Cygwin64 is needed to run the cpp files, since it has the libraries used for the sockets.
Install this for all users, making sure to install g++ (gcc-g++) with it so you can compile the cpp files if changes are made.

With these two programs installed, you should be able to just run the start.bat files and it should open a python window and a cmd windows, running the two separate codes.
I've made the bat files use dynamic paths so it should work on any windows system assuming you have python37 and Cygwin64 in the same location they're installed for me.
