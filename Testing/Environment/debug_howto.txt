To be able to run the cpp code in the debugger, "visual studio code" (VSC) is required.
"GDB" is required within cygwin64 to be able to attach the debugger to the running code.

You should use file->open folder on the environment folder to open the code to use.
The files in the .vscode folder should set up Cygwin as the terminal / shell within VSC.
There is a build task to build all of the cpp code using g++ to be run in debug.
  - You may need to rebuild the files before running debugger, which can be done by selecting
  the Terminal dropdown menu at the top of the screen and selecting run build task.
There is a launch configuration to run and attach the debugger to the cpp code.
With VSC open, you can click on the bug in a circle with a cross through it on the left toolbar to open the debug window of VSC.
With the debug window open, there should be a debug launch option in the top left corner called (gdb) Launch.
If everything is set up correctly, pressing green play should just start the program and run normally besides any breakpoints that are set.

To run the python half of the environment separately, there is a run_py.bat file.
Run the python window first then run the debugger version of the code to connect to the socket.
